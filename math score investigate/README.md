Abstract

Math scores in the U.S. both lag behind international competitors and exhibit achievement gaps
based on race and income, making it imperative that researchers discover the roots of the
problem and the most effective methods to fix it. 

This study uses multiple linear regression to
examine some of the variables that might be associated with associated with math achievement.
It uses a large national data set, the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009, to explore which
of 20 factors are most highly associated with studentsâ€™ test scores. Race and income remain
significant predictors of test scores even when holding other variables constant. 

Additionally,
individual-level factors such as interest in math, math self-efficacy, how much time one spends
on math homework, and whether one takes calculus are associated with higher math scores. Also,
though the years that a teacher spends teaching math is associated with higher test scores,
earning a higher degree is not. 

Finally, the percent of students at a school who go on to higher
education is associated with higher test scores, indicating there may be school-wide effects on
students. 

We suggest that future research should delve further into these relationships and test
them using experimental methods.
